<hr class="medium" />

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>"The Bolshevists," says a gossip
writer, "do not always rob Peter to
pay Paul." No, they sometimes just
rob Peter.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A Yarmouth report anticipates a
shortage of herrings. It is said that
the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> has a couple of
second-hand red ones for disposal which
have only been drawn across the path
once or twice.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"One of the Kaiser's mugs," says a
news item, "has just been sold
in New York for forty pounds."
We have suspected for some
time that he was a double-faced
fellow.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"There should be no temptations
to crime in so beautiful
a spot," said Mr. Justice <span class="sc">Coleridge</span>
when presented with
white gloves at the Anglesey
assizes. The sentiment is
thought to be as old as <span class="sc">Adam</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"If it is necessary to
strengthen the hands of the
military in Ireland," said Mr.
<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>, "the Government
will certainly do so."
Our own view is that they
should be protected even if it
means sending the Reserve of
Special Constables to do it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to the Ministry of
Transport, there is only one
motor-car to every one hundred
and twenty people in Great
Britain. The necessity of fixing
a maximum bag of pedestrians
per car does not therefore
arise.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A purple-eyed fish, eleven
feet long, with a horn on its
nose and no teeth, has been
caught at San Diego, California. That
is the sort of thing that makes Prohibition
a secondary issue.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>As the result of some remarks let
drop by the crew and repeated by the
ship's parrot, several hundred bottles
of liquor were found on board the
<i>S.S. Cura&ccedil;ao</i> by the San Francisco port
authorities. It is now suggested, in
the interests of philology, that the
parrot should be put back to hear how
the crew takes it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A young man while fishing on the
Wye landed a wallet containing twenty-two
one-pound Treasury notes. A correspondent
writing from North of the
Tweed inquires what bait the fellow
was using.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The <span class="sc">Postmaster-General</span> points out
that five hundred new telephones are
to be erected in rural districts. Local
residents should at least be grateful for
this little friendly warning.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is reported that <span class="sc">M. Krassin</span> told
the <span class="sc">Premier</span> all about Russia. Mr.
<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> was very interested, as
he had often heard of the place.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>With the letter postage at twopence,
we read, it is in many cases just as
cheap to telephone. And in some cases
just as quick.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Will Wilde meet Beckett?" asks a
headline. We can only say that we do
not intend to stand in their way.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>General <span class="sc">von Kluck</span> has been telling
somebody that he lost the battle of the
Marne by a fluke. As we can't have
the War over again we must let the
matter remain at that.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to an evening paper a
temperance speaker fainted during a
procession in a Kentish town, and was
immediately carried into a shop and
brought round by whisky. The report
that on being informed of this fact he
again went off into a faint is happily
without foundation.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A man aged seventy-six was charged
last week with threatening to shoot a
West-End family of six. It is said that
his parents intend to plead the baneful
influence of the cinema.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The fact that at least seven people
have expressed their intention of swimming
the English Channel this year
draws attention once more to the lack
of accommodation on our cross-Channel
steamers.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A wheelbarrow has been
presented to the parishioners
of Hornchurch, Essex. We
have maintained all along that
the motor-car craze would
wear itself out in time.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>On April the 21st the Maharajah
of <span class="sc">Bikanir</span> shot his hundredth
tiger. All efforts to induce
him to join the R.I.C.
have so far failed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The case is reported of a
hen which lays an egg each
morning on her master's bed
and then pecks his cheek to
wake him up at the proper
time for breakfast. Guess
where this happens. America?
Right.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We understand that in view
of the paper shortage the West
Drayton man who managed
to get through on the telephone
last week has abandoned
the idea of writing a book
about it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Much annoyance is said to
have been caused to one bricklayer
last week. It seems that
just before the dinner hour somebody
kicked away the brick he had laid and
the unfortunate fellow had to start the
day all over again.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to <i>The Manila Bulletin</i>
the cost of living is going to fall. Not
on us, we trust.</p>

<h4>I.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Responsibilities of Genius.</span></h4>

<h4><i>By Miss Dinkie Devereux, the renowned Film Favourite.</i></h4>

<p>The Editor of <i>The Weekly Newsbag</i> has kindly asked me
to write an article on the duty which we denizens of Flickerland
owe to the public. This, it happens, is a subject that
has long given me "furiously to think," as a witty Frenchman
once said in French. It may be of interest, by the
way, to state that I am myself partly of Gallic extraction,
my mother having been a Lyons girl before she was enabled
to open a tea-shop of her own; and, although born
and bred in what I am proud to call my native country, I
can even now act just as fluently in a French film as in an
all-British production.</p>

<p>But I must not let my thoughts run away with my pen,
fascinating though such cross-country excursions may be.
To return to my appointed topic, heavy indeed is the burden
that is laid on the back of a cinema star. You who know
me only as the reigning queen of countless Palaces may possibly
imagine that my life is spent in flitting butterfly-fashion
from film to film, existing only for the golden
moment. But one is not born a butterfly, nor does one
remain so without constant effort. The strenuous nature of
my labours indeed necessitates frequent periods of recuperation,
which I seek either in my Highland fastness, or
on my Californian peach-farm, or amid the lotus-bushes of
my villa on the Riviera. This, then, is one of my first duties
to the public&mdash;to preserve that Heaven-sent talent which,
in the words of mighty <span class="sc">Milton</span>, "is death to hide." (<span class="sc">Milton</span>,
I may say, is my favourite poet next to <span class="sc">George R.
Sims</span>, and "Odont" is my favourite mouth-wash.)</p>

<p>But the intervals between pictures are not all play. When
I receive notice of a forthcoming production in which my
services are entreated (and I owe it to humanity not to refuse
my co-operation provided certain bothersome preliminaries
of a financial nature are successfully negotiated), I
spend a considerable time steeping myself in the atmosphere
of the part I am to fill. One of my most famous
<i>r&ocirc;les</i>, as I need hardly mention, is that of <i>Lilian the Lift-Girl</i>,
in the great Solomonson six-reeler, <i>Ups and Downs</i>.
In order to prepare for this momentous undertaking I used
to visit Whiteridge's Stores daily and devote an hour or so
to travelling in the elevators; only thus could I hope to
attain the proper perspective. The attendants of course
knew me well and used to ply me with gifts of chocolates,
etc.; but after a time I was compelled to refuse these
touching offerings because my chauffeur has a tendency
to biliousness.</p>

<p>Then there is the sacred duty of looking after what my
Press agent is good enough to call my "unearthly charm."
I do not agree with the <i>dictum</i> that "we are as Heaven
made us," and I am sure no film enterprise could carry on
successfully on those lines. Of course you must have something
to work upon, and for the bare edifice of my beauty,
which in all humility I admit was raised by other hands than
mine, I claim no special praise. But I think I may justly
take credit for the structural alterations I have effected and
for the self-sacrificing labours I have willingly undergone
to maintain each of my features at its maximum efficiency;
to these the advertisement columns of the papers
bear constant testimony.</p>

<p>(In passing let me observe that I have always found
Mrs. Phipps's Face-Fodder of invaluable assistance in
"that fierce light which beats upon the screen," as dear old
<span class="sc">Tennyson</span>&mdash;another great favourite of mine&mdash;so nearly said.)</p>

<p>Naturally enough the public is always ravenous for information
concerning the minutest details of my life, and to
prevent disappointment in this respect I send the Press
a daily budget of my doings, entitled <i>Dinkie Day by Day</i>.
That is another burden I cheerfully shoulder, and by this
method my admirers are kept fully acquainted with what
I may call the real me&mdash;with the heart that beats beneath
the shadowed counterfeit. Nevertheless at times the most
absurd rumours get abroad. Recently, for example, I saw
it stated in quite a reputable organ that my favourite jam is
blackberry-and-apple; as a matter of fact I find all jams
ruinous to the figure, and as a tea-relish I usually limit
myself to the more ascetic bloater-paste, with salmon-and-shrimp
as an occasional variant.</p>

<p>My pet hobby is collecting precious stones, and my
favourites among these are pearls and diamonds, especially
of the larger variety. Frequently admirers of my art who
know of this harmless foible are good enough to add to my
collection, and these spontaneous tributes are among the
compensations of a life dedicated at every moment of the
day to the public service.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER DOG DISPUTE.</h3>

<p>As far as was revealed by the torn
remnants of posters adhering to Farmer
Pyke's barn, the only event of importance
in Little Spudsey since the
letting by auction of fifty-seven acres
of summer keeping in April, 1918, was
the Rural District Council Election in
March, 1920. Conspicuous mention
was made of Pyke, Cluttrel and Gedge,
Coalition Candidates, who had apparently
coalesced to crush one Winch,
Independent. I was endeavouring to
discover his fate when old William
Trimble doddered along.</p>

<p>"Marnin', Mr. Lomax," he said;
"you be back at last?"</p>

<p>I could not deny the fact.</p>

<p>"There be only Hosea Bennett an'
George Riley to coom now, an' the toll'll
be complete."</p>

<p>"Where are they now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"George be in India, or leastways 'e
was, an' Hosea's at Cologny. They'm
both expected back by Saturday fortnit,
an' th' question which on 'em really
owns th' Yarkshire tarrier'll have to
be settled once an' for all. Yon election
hinged on it."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I've forgotten the details,
William," I confessed lamely.</p>

<p>"You'll surely remember th' little
Yarkshire tarrier as strayed into th'
village in the summer o' '14," said
William. "Hosea claimed it as his'n
by right of hollering it first, but George
rackened him givin' it a bit o' bacon-rind
from 'is lunch med 'im th' rightful
owner. It stayed a few days wi' Hosea,
then George 'ticed it away, an' generally
it hung to the one as happened to have th'
biggest bone. Feeling ran high atween
them till, after the harvest 'ad bin got
in, Mr. Gedge, at The Chequers, axed
George what about j'ining up.</p>

<p>"'What, an' give Hosea a free run
wi' th' tarrier?' said George. 'Not
blessed likely.'</p>

<p>"Hosea for his part said 'e weren't
going to budge while th' village were
infested wi' dog-stealers; so Mr.
Gedge 'e says, 'Hand th' dog to me.
I'll howd it wi'out fear nor favour, an'
when you both cooms back we'll have
it properly arbitrated on.'</p>

<p>"So Hosea j'ined the Infantry an'
George went into th' Yeomanry. There
was some friction when George first
coom on leave an' Mr. Gedge let 'im
have th' tarrier for a day's ratting. Th'
Bennett family said it were breaking
the agreement, but Mr. Gedge said it
were a patriotic duty to give th' lads a
bit of amusement when they came on
leave, an' 'e 'd undertake the Rileys 'ud
make no objection when Hosea coom
home. But it made a lot 'o coolness
atween th' families, an' when Hosea
were wounded in '15 the Bennettses as
good as said th' Rileys weren't no
better nor pro-Germans in not giving
up their claim to th' tarrier. Public
opinion were with Hosea at that time,
but it veered round to George when 'e
won th' Military Medal in '16.</p>

<p>"However, George got orders to go East
in '17, an' Hosea had pretty frequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page465" id="page465"></a>[pg 465]</span>
leaves and were allus parading th' dog
outside the Rileys' cottage. About the
end o' '18 owd Ephraim Riley got tired
of it and went to see Mr. Gedge on th'
subject.</p>

<p>"'Fair's fair,' he says, 'an' Hosea
ain't no right to be worming 'is way
into that dog's affections while George
can't get home.'</p>

<p>"'There's summat in that,' said Mr.
Gedge; an' next time Hosea cooms
home 'e finds the dog in pound, so to
speak.</p>

<p>"'Very good,' says he; 'I don't coom
home again till George is here.'</p>

<p>"In th' spring of '19, 'bout the time
as the tarrier&mdash;which was getting owd
and cantankerous&mdash;bit Wilfred Browitt
in th' leg, we heerd that George weren't
likely to be back for a longish time, an'
Hosea wrote to say in that case he'd
take on in th' Army for another year.
Then we had mower excitement, for it
was said that Winch, a new-comer, had
put up for th' Council, an' it 'ud mean
an election. Fowks were so used to
Farmer Pyke an' Mr. Gedge and Mr.
Cluttrel setting that they rackened they
didn't need to be voted on, but would
go in automatic. However, there were
a meetin' in th' parish-room, an' when
Chairman axed if anyone 'ad any questions
Wilfred Browitt got up an' said:</p>

<p>"'Who owns tarrier, Hosea Bennett
or George Riley?'</p>

<p>"It were well known that Wilfred
were a mean-sperrited crittur as only
wanted to know from which one 'e 'd
be likely to get compensation for th'
bite on his leg. So Mr. Gedge 'e rose
an' answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'It's well known Mr. Pyke nor Mr.
Cluttrel nor self can't say anything on
the matter, as it is sub-judish till th'
lads coom home.'</p>

<p>"'What do you say, Mr. Winch?'
persisted Wilfred.</p>

<p>"'I declare for George Riley,' said
Winch boldly, 'him being the first to
give it sustenance.'</p>

<p>"There were a great sensation at that,
an' it showed the cunningness o' Winch.
He knew the Rileys were intermarried
wi' half th' village and all George's
relations 'ud be bound to vote for 'im
after he'd declared for them. And so
it proved, for, though th' Bennettses
rallied everyone they could for th' Coalitioners,
they weren't strong enough, an
Winch got in in place o' Mr. Cluttrel."</p>

<p>"Still," I remarked, "the question of
ownership isn't settled."</p>

<p>"No, that'll be settled Saturday fortnit.
It'll be a rare set-back for Winch
if the verdict goes to Hosea."</p>

<p>"But in any case the terrier is sure
of a good home," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, as to that," replied William,
"it were the principle o' the thing that
were at stake. When th' tarrier bit
Wilfred Browitt in '19 he chased it out
of th' village wi' his stick, an' nobody
ain't seen it since."</p>

<h3>A PRISCILLA DIALOGUE.</h3>

<p>There is probably some way by which
a young female child can be led through
easy stages of Socratic dialogue to
the idea of ultimate truth in morals as
well as art. There is probably some
way of talking to such a child without
being badly scored off. But I do not
seem to have the gift. This is the more
unfortunate because the thing usually
happens before I have finished my
breakfast, and nothing is quite so damaging
to my self-esteem as to be soundly
snubbed in my own house before the
day's work has begun.</p>

<p>Mind you I do not honestly believe
that my logic is at fault. I believe that
there is usually a flaw in the reasoning
of the child. But you cannot very well
say to an infant of three, "You are now
being guilty of an undistributed middle
or a <i>petitio elenchi</i> or whatever it is."
She would do what I have heard even
older women do in like circumstances.
She would change the subject at once.
Perhaps the <span class="sc">Montessori</span> system ...
But let us take a typical case.</p>

<p>I found her sitting at a large table
by the dining-room window, in a high
chair that left her red shoes eighteen
inches from the ground, a complete
doll's tea service in front of her and a
small stuffed lamb on her right-hand
side. The tea-pot appeared to contain
real water and the sugar-basin real
sugar, and although she was supremely
busy watering and sugaring and rearranging
her cups and jugs and spoons
she greeted me with the composure of an
experienced <i>ch&acirc;telaine</i>. Our conversation
went something like this:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Will you have any cup of tea?</p>

<p><i>I</i> (<i>having drunk a small cup of water
with a very little real sugar and a large
quantity of real grit in it</i>.) Thank you.
How delicious! But I must go and have
my breakfast now.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>taking no notice at all and offering
me a small fragment of moist toast</i>).
Will you have any piece of cake?</p>

<p><i>I.</i> Thank you. What lovely plum-cake!</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>with infinite scorn</i>). Ho! that
isn't <i>plum</i>-cake. There isn't any plums
in it. It's <i>choclat</i> cake.</p>

<p><i>I</i> (<i>humiliated</i>). Oh, well, I don't
think I will have any more tea, thank
you.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>coldly</i>). I'm going to give my
lamb tea now.</p>

<p>[<i>The method of giving tea to a lamb,
in case it is not generally known,
is to plaster the lamb's nose with
spoonfuls of sugar and then lick
off the sugar with one's tongue.
At least that is the way Priscilla
does it.</i>]</p>

<p><i>I</i> (<i>reprovingly from the breakfast-table</i>.)
What a funny way to give your
lamb tea, Priscilla.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> My lamb says he likes having
his tea like this. (<i>A longish pause.</i>)
Please will you draw me a picsher?</p>

<p><i>I.</i> What kind of a picture?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> A picsher of a house.</p>

<p><i>I.</i> What kind of a house?</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>in one long breath</i>). A purple
house with a yellow roof and blue
curtains and a green door and rose-trees
with red roses and hollyhocks and a
dear little pussy-cat and a motor-car
coming up the drive.</p>

<p>[<i>This is executed in coloured crayons
with a rapidity born of hunger
and long practice, and passed to
the Hanging Committee for inspection.</i>]</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>examining it critically</i>). Ho!
that isn't a <i>door</i>.</p>

<p><i>I.</i> Yes, it is, Priscilla. It's a very nice
<i>door</i>.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> It isn't a door. It hasn't any
knocker.</p>

<p>[<i>After all, when</i> is <i>a door not a
door? I finish the joinery job
and carry on with my bacon.</i>]</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>suddenly</i>). There isn't any sun.</p>

<p>[<i>I sketch in the regulation pattern
of circular sun, with eyes, a nose
and a smile complete.</i>]</p>

<p><i>She.</i> That isn't a sun. It hasn't any
hair.</p>

<p><i>I.</i> The sun doesn't have any hair,
Priscilla.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>decisively</i>). Nurse has hair.</p>

<p>[<i>This really seems unanswerable.
Having amended Ph&oelig;bus Apollo
I start in with my marmalade.
After a lapse of a few minutes a
low hammering is heard from
somewhere on the floor at the far
side of the table.</i>]</p>

<p><i>I.</i> Whatever are you doing, Priscilla?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Sooing my horse.</p>

<p>[<i>She is discovered beating the
wheels of a grey wooden flat-backed
animal on a stand with
a hammer procured from heaven
alone knows where.</i>]</p>

<p><i>I.</i> Well, don't hit him on the wheels,
anyhow. (<i>A pause, subdued noises and
a sigh.</i>) What are you doing now,
Priscilla?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Sooing him on his back.</p>

<p><i>I.</i> Doesn't that hurt him?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> It hurts him very much, but he
doesn't <i>say</i> anything.</p>

<p>[<i>I come round to give veterinary
advice.</i>]</p>

<p><i>I.</i> Don't you love your horse, Priscilla?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Yes, he's my friendly horse.</p>

<p><i>I.</i> Well, don't bang him about like
that; all the paint's coming off him.</p>

<p>[<i>The carpet is in fact bestrewn with
small flakes of grey paint from
the unhappy creature's flanks.</i>]</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>derisively</i>). Ho! that isn't paint.
That's snorts.</p>

<p><i>I</i> (<i>helplessly</i>). Whatever do you mean?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> That's snorts. Snorts from his
mouf. White snorts.</p>

<p><i>I.</i> But why is your horse snorting
from his mouth, Priscilla?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> He's snorting from his mouf
because I'm sooing him on his back.</p>

<p>Well, there you are, you know; what
is one going to do about it? There is a
sort of specious plausibility about these
replies after all; I am no farrier, but I
should think it quite likely that if you
shoed a cart-horse long enough on the
back with a large enough hammer he
<i>would</i> snort white snorts from his
mouth; and it's no use telling the girl
that she can't jump from realism to
romance in that disingenuous manner.
Besides she might start hammering the
wheels again. Or else she would say
that her horse <i>said</i> he was snorting,
and who am I to contradict a British
horse? I used to consider myself pretty
good at what are called back-answers
and I still believe that with a little
practice I could hold my own in Whitechapel
or the House of Commons, but
there are subtle transitions about Priscilla's
method of argument with which
only a Prime Minister could cope. It
carries too many guns for me. It
cramps my style.</p>

<h3>LITTLE BITS OF LONDON.</h3>

<h4><span class="sc">Billingsgate.</span></h4>

<p>In order to see Billingsgate properly
in action it is necessary to get up at
half-past four and travel on the Underground
by the first train East, which
is an adventure in itself. The first
train East goes at three minutes past
five, and there are large numbers of
people who travel in it every day; by
Charing Cross it is almost crowded.
It is full of Bolshevists; and I do not
wonder. One sits with one's feet up
in a first-class carriage, clutching a
nice cheap workman's ticket and trying
hard to look as if, like the Bolshevists,
one did this every day.</p>

<p>On arriving at the Monument Station
one walks briskly past the seductive
announcement that "<span class="sc">The Monument
is Now Open</span>," and plunges into a
world of fish. I have never been able
to understand why fish is so funny. On
the comic stage a casual reference to fish
is almost certain to provoke a shout of
laughter; in practice, and especially in
the mass, it is not so funny; it is like the
Government, an inexhaustible source of
humour at a distance, and in the flesh
extraordinarily dull.</p>

<p>Over the small streets which surround
the market hangs a heavy pall
of fishy vapour. The streets are full
of carts; the carts are full of fish. The
houses in the streets are fish-dealers'
places, more or less full of fish. The
pavements are full of fish-porters,
carrying fish, smelling of fish. Fragments
of conversation are heard, all
about fish. Fish lie sadly in the gutters.
The scales of fish glitter on the pavements.
A little vigorous swimming
through the outlying fisheries brings
you to the actual market, which is even
more wonderful. Imagine a place like
Covent Garden, and nearly as big, but
entirely devoted to fish. In the place of
those enchanting perspectives of flower-stalls,
imagine enormous regiments of
fish-stalls, paraded in close order and
groaning with halibut and conger-eel,
with whiting and lobsters and huge
crabs. Round these stalls the wholesale
dealers wade ankle-deep in fish.
Steadily, maliciously, the great fish slide
off the stalls on to the floor; steadily
the dealers recover them and pile them
up on their small counters, or cast them
through the air on to other counters, or
fling them into baskets in rage or mortification
or sheer bravado.</p>

<p>The dealers are men with business-faces,
in long white coats, surprisingly
clean. Every now and then they stop
throwing crabs into baskets or retrieving
halibut from the floor, and make
little entries in long note-books. I do
not know exactly what entries they
make, but I think they must all be in for
some competition, and are making notes
about their scores; one man I watched
had obviously just beaten the record
for halibut-recovery. He recovered so
many in about a minute that the tops of
his boots were just beginning to show.
When he had done that he made such
long notes in his book about it that
most of the halibut slid on to the floor
again while he was doing it. Then he
began all over again. But I expect he
won the prize.</p>

<p>Meanwhile about a million fish-porters
are dashing up and down the
narrow avenues between the fish-stalls,
porting millions of boxes of fish. Nearly
all of them, I am glad to say, have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page469" id="page469"></a>[pg 469]</span>
in the army or have had a relative in
the army; for they are nearly all wearing
the full uniform of a company cook,
which needs no description. On their
heads they have a kind of india-rubber
hat, and on the india-rubber hat they
have a large box of fish weighing about
six stone&mdash;six <i>stone</i>, I tell you. This
box they handle as if it was a box of
cigars. They pick it up with a careless
gesture; they carry it as if it was a
slightly uncomfortable hat, and they
throw it down with another careless
gesture, usually on to another box of
fish; this explains why so many of
one's herrings appear to have been
maimed at sea.</p>

<p>When they have finished throwing
the boxes about they too take out a
note-book and make notes about it all.
This, it seems, is to make sure that they
are paid something for throwing each
box about. I don't blame them. It
must be a hard life. Yet if I thought
I could pick up six stone of salmon and
plaice and throw it about I should sign
on at Billingsgate at once. It is true
they start work about five; but they stop
work, it seems, about ten, and they
earn a pound and over for that. Then
they can go home. Most of them, I
imagine, are stockbrokers during the
rest of the day.</p>

<p>And they are a refined and gentlemanly
body of men. I hope the old
legend that the fish-porter of Billingsgate
expresses himself in terms too
forcible for the ordinary man is now
exploded; for it is a slander. In fact
it is a slander to call him a "porter;"
at least in these days I suppose it is
libellous to connect a man falsely with
the N.U.R., if only by verbal implication.
But, however that may be, I
here assert that the Billingsgate fish-porter
is a comparatively smooth and
courteous personage, and, considering
his constant association with fish in
bulk, I think it is wonderful.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:400px;"><a href="images/469-1000.png"><img src="images/469-310.png" width="310" height="465" alt="'Either terbakker isn't wot it wos&mdash;or these 'ere toffs ain't.'" /></a>
<p><i>Connoisseur (smoking cigarette stump just thrown away by
passer-by)</i>. "<span class="sc">Either
terbakker isn't wot it wos&mdash;or these 'ere toffs ain't</span>."</p></div>

<p>At the far end of the market is the
river Thames; and on the river Thames
there is a ship or two chockful of fish.
Fish-porters with a kind of <i>blas&eacute;</i> animation
run up and down a long gangway
to the ship with six-stone boxes of
fine fresh whiting on their heads. These
boxes they pile up on a chute (carefully
noting each box in their note-books),
after which an auctioneer auctions the
boxes. This is the really exciting part
of the show. The dealers or the dealers'
agents stand round in a hungry ring
and buy the boxes of fish as they slide
down the chute. The dealers seem to
detail a less cultured type of man for
this purpose, and few of the bidders
come up to the standard of refinement
of the fish-porters. But the auctioneer
understands them, and he knows all
their Christian names. He can tell at
a glance whether it is Mossy Isaacs or
Sam Isaacs. He is a very clever man.</p>

<p>They stand round looking at the
boxes of fish, and when one of them
twitches the flesh of his nose or faintly
moves one of his eyelashes it means
that he has bought six stone of whiting
for thirty shillings. That is the only
kind of sign they give, and the visitor
will be wise not to catch the auctioneer's
eye, or blow his nose or do any overt
action like that, or he may find that he
has bought six stone of salmon and
halibut for forty-five shillings. At an
auction of fish it is true to say that a
nod is as good as a wink; in fact it is
worse.</p>

<p>The dealers are silent motionless
men; but nobody else is. Everybody
else is dashing about and shouting as
loud as he can. As each box of fish is
sold the porters dash at it and shout at
it (of course in a very gentlemanly way)
and carry it off in all directions. It is
quite clear that nobody knows who has
bought it and where it is going. The
idea of the whole thing is to impress
the visitor with the mobility of fish, and
this object is successfully attained. No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page470" id="page470"></a>[pg 470]</span>
doubt when the visitors have gone away
they settle down and decide definitely
whom the fish belongs to.</p>

<p>It is now about half-past six. Fish
is still rushing in at one end from the
ship and is rushing in at the other
from the railway-vans. The porters are
throwing the fish at the dealers' stalls
(registering each hit in their note-books),
and the dealers are throwing it on to
the floor or throwing it at each other
or trying to throw it at a retailer, who
always puts on a haughty air and passes
on to the next stall, till he too gets entangled
in the game and finds that he
has bought twenty-four stone of whiting
at twopence a pound; then he throws
it at some more porters, and the porters
dash outside and throw it at the carts,
and the carts clatter away to Kensington,
and my wife buys a whiting at tenpence
a pound, and the circle of fish
organisation is complete.</p>

<p>At about this point it is a good thing
to pass on to Covent Garden and buy
some flowers.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/473-a-640.png"><img src="images/473-a-300.png" width="300" height="436" alt="'MANY YEARS AGO.'" /></a>
"MANY YEARS AGO."

<p><span class="sc"> Sir Eric Geddes at a Sunday School treat.</span></p></div>
<p><i>Monday, June 7th.</i>&mdash; "Has the right
hon. gentleman any experience of Sunday
School treats?" asked Mr. <span class="sc">Inskip</span>
after the <span class="sc">Minister of Transport</span> had
announced that the railway companies,
while conceding reduced fares for these
outings, could not extend the facilities
to more than one adult for every ten
children. Sir <span class="sc">Eric Geddes</span> admitted
that his experience was "many years
ago." There must have been "giants
in those days" among the Sunday
School teachers if one of them was able
to "moderate the transports" of ten
little <span class="sc">Erics</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> had discarded
the jaunty grey suit which he wore last
week, and in his "blacks" looked rather
like a Scottish elder. Nevertheless, when
requested by Mr. <span class="sc">MacCallum Scott</span> to
interpret the articles of the "Auld Kirk"
he declined to rush in where Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar
Law</span> had feared to tread, and contented
himself with the remark that this was
"a very dangerous question for a mere
Southerner."</p>

<p>The negotiations with <span class="sc">M. Krassin</span>
caused many inquiries. Mr. <span class="sc">William
Shaw</span>, for example, sought a guarantee
that the Bolshevists should not be allowed
to pay for the goods they might
now order with the stores that they
had seized from His Majesty's Government.
One is reminded of <span class="sc">Phil May's</span>
publican, who took the theft of his pewters
philosophically,
but was moved to
strong protest when
the thief brought them
back in the form of
bad half-crowns.</p>

<p>Coalitionist anxiety
in regard to the <span class="sc">Prime
Minister's</span> flirtation
with the Soviet emissary
took shape in a
motion for the adjournment
moved by
Colonel <span class="sc">Gretton</span>, who
was shocked at the
idea of negotiating
with a Government
that depended on violence,
and seconded
by Admiral Sir <span class="sc">R.
Hall</span>, who doubted
whether there was
anything to be got out
of Russia. Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd
George</span> replied that,
according to the evidence
of anti-Bolshevist refugees, there
were quantities of grain and raw materials
awaiting export, while in regard
to the general question he poured much
rhetorical contempt on the argument
that we were never to trade with a
country that was misgoverned. What
about Turkey? What about Mexico?
"You cannot always examine the records
of your customers."</p>

<p>Earlier in the day Sir A. <span class="sc">Griffith
Boscawen</span> had moved the Second
Reading of the Agriculture Bill with
so much vigour and enthusiasm that
one wondered why a Bill so vital to
the national well-being had not been introduced
a little earlier. Later speakers
were less friendly. Mr. <span class="sc">Acland</span> declared
that the measure was only necessary
because the Government could not
keep the country out of international
difficulties. Captain <span class="sc">Fitzroy</span> complained
that the Bill did too much for
the tenant-farmer; whereas Mr. <span class="sc">Cautley</span>
described it as the tenant-farmer's
death-knell.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, June 8th.</i>&mdash; The prevalent
belief that Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span> is always
spoiling for a fight, and is mainly responsible
for all the wars now going on
in various parts of the world, is, I am
ready to believe, entirely erroneous.
But there is no doubt of his desire to
"see red" so far as His Majesty's Army
is concerned. The report that the
Government intended to spend three
millions in putting our soldiers back
into the traditional scarlet inspired a
multitude of questions to the <span class="sc">War Secretary</span>
this afternoon. Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span>
declared it to be grossly exaggerated.
Nevertheless, in political circles it is
believed that at the next election the
Government can rely with confidence
upon the nurserymaids' vote.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/473-b-1000.png"><img src="images/473-b-600.png" width="600" height="406" alt="MR. CHURCHILL SEES RED." /></a>
<h3>MR. CHURCHILL SEES RED.</h3>
<p><span class="sc"> Army Uniform (1) as it is; (2) As it was before the war and will be

should have been</span>.</p></div>

<p>In resisting the proposal to make
a levy on capital Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>
covered the ground so exhaustively
that, as Sir <span class="sc">F. Banbury</span> subsequently
observed, the chief complaint to be
made of his speech was that it was not
delivered three months before, when it
would have saved the money-market
great anxiety and prevented much depreciation
of capital. For, according
to the <span class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>,
a levy on war-wealth was never really
practicable, and even if it had been
would have had no effect upon the
amount of the floating
debt, his most pressing
problem. But, if
so, why not have said
it at the start, instead
of setting up a Committee
to try to find
a solution for the insoluble?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain's</span>
contention that by the
income-tax and super-tax
wealth was already
heavily conscripted
would have perhaps
been better left without
illustration. His
case of the gentleman
with &pound;131,000 a
year, who after paying
his taxes had only
&pound;42,500 to spend, left
Mr. <span class="sc">Stephen Walsh</span>
quite cold. Sir <span class="sc">Donald
Maclean</span>, by some
odd process of reasoning,
came to the conclusion that the
Government's decision would be welcomed
by all the enemies of capital,
and announced his intention of joining
the Labour Party in the Lobby.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, June 9th.</i>&mdash; The Air Navigation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474"></a>[pg 474]</span>
Bill passed through the usually
serene atmosphere of the Upper House,
but not without encountering a certain
number of "bumps." Lord <span class="sc">Montagu</span>,
calling to mind the nursery saying, "if
pigs could fly," was alarmed by the
possibility that "air-hogs" might interfere
with the amenities, and might even
endanger the lives, of earth-bound citizens
by flying over them at unduly low
altitudes. He suggested two thousand
feet as a minimum. Lord <span class="sc">Londonderry</span>
resisted the Amendment on the ground
that it was difficult to gauge the height
at which aircraft flew, and thought few
airmen would care to risk the penalties
provided in the Bill&mdash;a fine of two hundred
pounds and six months' imprisonment&mdash;by
indulging a taste for forbidden
stunts.</p>

<p>At first blush you would hardly think
it necessary to include the City Corporation
among the local authorities who
may establish aerodromes. The "one
square mile" does not offer much encouragement
to the airman who wishes
to make a safe landing. But you never
can tell what may happen. The "Old
Lady of Threadneedle Street," who is
said to be contemplating an upward extension
of her premises, may perhaps
welcome aeroplanes to her hospitable
roof, and thereby give a new significance
to "banking" in the aviator's vocabulary.</p>

<p>In the Commons the anomalous position
produced by President <span class="sc">Wilson</span>'s
undertaking to delimit the boundaries
of Armenia, although his country has
refused to accept the mandate for its
administration, elicited from Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar
Law</span> the curious explanation that the
invitation to delimit was addressed to
Mr. <span class="sc">Wilson</span> "in his personal capacity."
But when Mr. <span class="sc">Bottomley</span> sought further
light on this phrase Mr. <span class="sc">Law</span> was
unable or unwilling to supply it. He
did, however, vouchsafe the information
that, whatever America might do, this
country would not add Armenia to its
existing share of "the white man's
burden."</p>

<p><i>Thursday, June 10th.</i>&mdash;It seems a
pity that since Count <span class="sc">de Salis</span> left
Montenegro and made his famous
secret report the British Government
has had no representative in that distracted
country. In the absence of
official information the most diverse
descriptions of its present state gain
currency. According to Lord <span class="sc">Sydenham</span>
the Serbians, who wish to incorporate
Montenegro in the new Jugo-Slavia,
are taking every step to intimidate
their opponents (described as ninety
per cent. of the population) and have
incidentally imprisoned a number of
ex-Ministers. Lord <span class="sc">Curzon</span> agreed
that this was quite probable, inasmuch
as ex-Ministers bore a considerable ratio
to the whole population, but otherwise
challenged Lord <span class="sc">Sydenham</span>'s allegations.
His own information (source
not named) was that the Montenegrin
majority was in favour of Yugo-Slav
union. The debate confirmed the impression
that all statements emanating
from the Black Mountain should be
taken <i>cum grano</i> <span class="sc">de Salis</span>.</p>

<p>In the Commons Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span>
was taking a day off, and, as usually
happens when the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> is
in charge, "a certain liveliness" prevailed.
The renewed offensive of General
<span class="sc">Wrangel</span> incited the Bolshevist
sympathisers to start one on their own
account. An attempt to move the adjournment
was nipped in the bud by the
<span class="sc">Speaker</span>. Colonel <span class="sc">Wedgwood</span> made a
gallant effort to usurp the functions
of the Chair by declaring that the
matter was both definite and urgent;
but Mr. <span class="sc">Lowther</span> replied that unfortunately
the decision rested with him
and not with the hon. Member.</p>

<p>The House then settled down to
business, and gave a Third Reading to
two Bills, and a Second Reading to
five others. On the Women, Young
Persons and Children (Employment)
Bill Mr. <span class="sc">Barnes</span> took exception, not
unnaturally, to a clause permitting "the
employment of women and young persons
in shifts up to ten o'clock at night,"
and Major <span class="sc">Baird</span> undertook to consider
the withdrawal of this equivocal piece
of draftsmanship.</p>

<h3>THE FUTURE OF APSLEY HOUSE.</h3>

<h4><span class="sc">Conflicting Statements.</span></h4>

<p>The possibility of a super-dancing-saloon
being erected on the site of
Apsley House is, we fear, likely to be
relegated to the limbo of lost opportunities.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that a few
weeks ago London in general and the
West-End in particular was excited and
delighted by the announcement that
Apsley House had been sold to an influential
syndicate and would shortly
be converted into a massive and
monumental block, forty storeys high,
crowned with the dancing-saloon and
including a concert-hall with the most
powerful organ in the world, and a
swimming-bath with salt water conveyed
by a special pipe from Brighton.</p>

<p>It will also be remembered that Mr.
Chumpley Swope, the chairman of the
syndicate, issued a powerful manifesto
in which he explained the purely humanitarian
motives of the enterprise&mdash;to
obliterate the militaristic associations
of the site; to replace an unsightly
building by a fabric which would
be one of the architectural glories of
London, and simultaneously to cheer
the patients in St. George's Hospital
with the sounds of harmony by night.</p>

<p>Unhappily the realisation of these
beneficent and artistic designs seems
likely to be indefinitely postponed, to
judge from the authoritative statements
made to our representative by Mr.
Doremus Pomerene, architect to the
owners, and by Mr. Chumpley Swope
himself.</p>

<p>"There never was any idea," said
Mr. Pomerene, "in the minds of the
present owners, Mr. Otis Flather and
Mr. Virgil Onderdonk, of converting the
site of Apsley House to the uses of a
super-dancing-saloon. Mr. Flather is
a convinced opponent of the dancing
mania and President of the Anti-Tarantulation
League, while Mr. Onderdonk
has always been a profound admirer
of the great Duke of <span class="sc">Wellington</span>.
Subject to the approval of the present
Duke it is our intention to re-erect
Apsley House on the Playing Fields at
Eton, and utilise the site for the building
of flats for the New Poor."</p>

<p>"The erection of a Neo-Georgian
super-dancing-saloon on the Piccadilly
frontage of Apsley House," said Mr.
Chumpley Swope, "has long been the
dearest dream of my heart. My first
negotiations with Messrs. Shumway
and Prudden were conducted for the
express purpose of facilitating the realisation
of this project. Moreover, when
Mr. Flather joined me in the purchase
of the entire site his representative, Mr.
Onderdonk, was fully aware of my
plans and expressed his cordial approval
thereof.</p>

<p>"Eventually my friends and I accepted
offers made to us by Mr. Flather
whereby the entire site was vested
in him, subject to an agreement that
the Piccadilly frontage to a depth of
two hundred kilowatts should be reserved
for the erection of the dancing-saloon,
the concert-hall and the swimming-bath.</p>

<p>"Owing however to the difficulties
connected with the laying of the pipe
from Brighton and the unaccountable
and irrational hostility displayed by the
Governing Body of St. George's Hospital
the plan of erecting this Temple
of Terpsichore has fallen into abeyance
and the West-End is threatened with
the loss of an educational asset of incomparable
value. I may add, however,
that negotiations have been opened with
the Dean and Chapter of <span class="sc">Westminster</span>
and that I do not altogether despair of
obtaining an alternative site and making
a fresh start with my plans for beautifying
and humanising London."</p>

<h3>PERSISTENCE OF THE MILITARY.</h3>

<p>In pre-war days, when one's health was tested at the
order of a verbally polite but fundamentally distrustful insurance
company, the examination was a pleasant affair,
conducted by a benign old gentleman who behaved like
one's own family physician.</p>

<p>Now all that is changed. I lately took the liberty of
offering to bet a Company that I would not live for ever, in
spite of my present rude health. In reply I was invited
"to meet our medical advisers at our office."</p>

<p>I arrived obediently at the appointed time and was
ushered into a room in which sat behind a table two elderly
gentlemen of ultra-military appearance. When, later, they
addressed each other as "Colonel" and "Major" I knew
that they were civilian dug-outs militarised by the War.</p>

<p>Colonel drew himself up and spoke to me in a C.O. voice:
"Well, what is the general state of your health?"</p>

<p>I felt that it was up to me to play the old war-game,
even if it ruined my chance of getting insured. I therefore
started to enumerate the various minor ailments from which
I suffered.</p>

<p>"To begin with," I explained, "I've sprained my wrist
rather badly and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That won't prevent your holding a rifle," interrupted
Colonel severely.</p>

<p>"Then," I continued, "sometimes I have a headache."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Major, "and I suppose when you run uphill
your heart palpitates like a pea in a drum?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied quickly, "it does do that. How did you
know?"</p>

<p>Major laughed a laugh such as <span class="sc">Hindenburg</span> himself
might have delivered. It was cold and mirthless and must
have hurt his face.</p>

<p>"Come," said Colonel sharply, "let's have no more of
this humbug. Drink and smoke less and keep yourself fit;
and don't come whining before us, complaining of this and
that. A few route marches will soon set you up."</p>

<p>"But, seriously," I objected, "my health is not of the
best and I feel I ought to warn you that there are slight
disabilities in my constitution which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which make you," interjected Major, "of course unfit to
do your duty." His voice was like steel wire and I hated
him.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," I answered calmly, "I will say no more."</p>

<p>"You'd better not," roared Colonel. "It's no use your
thinking you can impose on us. I've marked you down
A1. I'm sick to death of you fellows who try to get behind
a doctor directly your comfort is threatened. That disposes
of <i>your</i> case. About&mdash;turn!"</p>

<p>Mechanically I left their presence....</p>

<p>I don't know what the Insurance Company will make
of it when they find all their candidates passed as first-class
lives. Somebody ought to tell these doctors that the War
is over.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER POST-OFFICE HOLD-UP.</h3>

<p>Our post-office is to be found taking cover in one corner
of the village's general shop. Poetically it may be described
as between the lard and the lingerie. In prose the most
interesting thing to be said of it is that I was there this
morning.</p>

<p>It was while I was buying a box of matches that the
thought came to me that I might as well enjoy myself
thoroughly and have some stamps as well. There was
quite a crowd in the shop at the time, and we both moved
to the postal counter together. She, however, got in the
first word.</p>

<p>"One stamp, please," she demanded, and went on, "You'll
never guess what I want it for."</p>

<p>"Isn't it for a letter, then?" asked the post-mistress, as
if, for instance, stamps might be used for holding down the
butter while the bread is rubbed against it.</p>

<p>"Yes, but who to? That's the point. Our George!"</p>

<p>To me there did not seem much in this to cause a sensation,
but it did. Question and answer flew backwards and
forwards as thick as reminiscences at a regimental dinner.</p>

<p>"Not young George?"</p>

<p>"Yes, old George. We had a letter from him last week.
First we'd heard for six years."</p>

<p>"Lordy, lordy," said the post-mistress, "it only seems
yesterday that he went away. I remember&mdash;&mdash;" and she
proved it by doing so for ten minutes with a volubility that
would have made the fortune of a patter comedian. At
the first sign of a pause I found the courage to ask for my
stamps, but quite in vain. The conversation was only
getting its second wind.</p>

<p>"Young George, to be sure! And how is he? Tell me
all about him."</p>

<p>I gathered that George was in the best of health and in
America, was unmarried and umpired out in a recent baseball
match and wanted&mdash;&mdash;" ["A dozen stamps, please."
This from me.] a photograph of the old people and his
brothers and sisters. From this the transition was easy to
an uncle of the post-mistress's who went&mdash;&mdash;" ["A dozen
stamps."]&mdash;to foreign parts. He always was a rolling stone,
he was. Never gathered no moss. On the other hand, there
were no flies on him. Did very well for himself, he did, and
when he died&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But it was at this point that the moisture from the
margarine cask against which I had been leaning began to
make its presence felt, and, stampless, I left the shop.</p>

<p>At the edge of the village I met our policeman.</p>

<p>"Go quickly," I implored him; "there's a hold-up at the
post-office."</p>

<p>Perhaps "quickly" is not quite the right word, but, at
any rate, he went. I doubt if he will get promotion over
the job, but I am sure he too will like to hear about our
George, if there's anything left to say by the time he gets
there.</p>

<h3>THE PARADISE OF BARDS.</h3>

<h4>(<i>From an Oxford Correspondent.</i>)</h4>

<p>Considerable resentment has been
caused in various centres of poetic activity
by the preference recently expressed
by the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> for the
products of Welsh minstrelsy. In a
letter addressed to <span class="sc">Huw Menai</span>, the
working South Wales miner poet, Mr.
<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> declares that he has
read his poems with the "greatest delight."
If the <span class="sc">Premier</span> had merely
said "great delight" no untoward consequences
would have ensued, but the invidious
use of the superlative threatens
to embroil the whole country in that
internecine war recently predicted by
the Editor of <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> in his
gloomy survey of Neo-Georgian literature.</p>

<p>Meetings of protest have been held in
Hampstead, at Letchworth, Stratford-on-Avon
and the Eustace Miles Restaurant,
but the most remarkable and orderly
of these demonstrations was that which
took place at Boar's Hill on Saturday
last, under the presidency of the <span class="sc">Poet
Laureate</span>. Boar's Hill, we need not
remind our readers, is <i>par excellence</i>
the fashionable intellectual suburb of
Oxford, and has been called the "Paradise
of Bards." Dr. <span class="sc">Bridges</span> in a
brief opening address, speaking more in
sorrow than in anger, dealt with the
statistical side of the question. He
pointed out that of the residents at
Boar's Hill one in every six was a true
poet, and three out of every five were
masters of the art of prosody. There
were no miner poets on Boar's Hill.
Their motto was <i>Majora canamus</i>.</p>

<p>Professor <span class="sc">Gilbert Murray</span>, who
followed, laid stress on the perfect
harmony which reigned amongst the
residents, in spite of the fact that all
schools of poetry were represented,
from the austerest of classicists to
the most advanced exponents of Neo-Georgian
<i>vers libre</i>. They were a
happy family, linked together by a
common devotion to the Muses, and in
their daily output of verse showing a
higher unit of production than that
recorded of any other community in
either hemisphere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">John Masefield</span> moved the only
resolution, which was carried unanimously,
to the effect that Mr. <span class="sc">Fisher</span>,
the Minister of Education, should be
requested to convey to the <span class="sc">Prime
Minister</span> the regret of the meeting
that he should have overlooked the
paramount claim of Boar's Hill to be
regarded as the Parnassus of Great
Britain. In <i>Murray's Guide to Oxfordshire</i>
it had been spoken of as "a health
resort for jaded students," but that
was an obsolete libel. Constitutionally
vigorous and daily refreshed by draughts
from the pellucid springs of the Pierides,
they led a life of exuberant health, as
the vital statistics of the neighbourhood
would abundantly show. On Boar's
Hill people began to write poetry earlier
and continued to do so later than in
any other spot in the British Isles.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Arthur Evans</span>, in proposing a
vote of thanks to the Chairman, made
the gratifying announcement that Mr.
<span class="sc">Masefield</span> was already engaged on a
companion poem to his "Reynard the
Fox," commemorating the <i>genius loci</i>
under the inspiring title of "The Sticking
of the Pig."</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING OFFICE.</h3>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

<p>Recent developments have given an unexpectedly topical
interest to a new book by Professor <span class="sc">Paul Miliukov</span>, L.L.D.,
entitled <i>Bolshevism: an International Danger</i> (<span class="sc">Allen and
Unwin</span>). The whole question of the <i>de facto</i> Government
of Russia is so fiercely controversial that it is not to be
expected that such a work should escape violent criticism
from those for whom that Government can do no wrong,
though the writer justly claims that (however obvious his
own views) he has striven to be strictly fair to those of the
enemy. The scheme of his work has been "to trace the
evolution of Bolshevism from an abstract doctrine to a
practical experiment." One may excusably find the history
a grim and menacing one. In the course of it Professor
<span class="sc">Miliukov</span> tells again the tragedy of the great betrayal
(which it will do no one harm to ponder upon just now),
when the Commander of the 1st corps of the Siberian
Army reported: "A brilliant success crowned our efforts ...
there remained before us only a few fortifications, and the
battle might soon have taken the character of a complete
destruction of the enemy." But the work of <span class="sc">M. Lenin</span> had
been too thorough; instead of a victory that might have
ended the War and saved thousands of lives, we saw this
already triumphant army, equipped through British industry,
melt into a disorganised rabble. Nor is the writer
less interesting on other aspects of his theme; in particular
an exposition of the notorious Third International and a
survey of the present-moment activities of Bolshevist propaganda,
notably in our own country. No one who wishes
to read and keep for reference a clearly written and
understandable survey of the most urgent problem in
modern politics need go further than this short but highly
concentrated study.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>The March to Paris and the Battle of the Marne, 1914</i>
(<span class="sc">Arnold</span>), by Generaloberst <span class="sc">Alexander Von Kluck</span>, is
more of a soldiers', indeed a staff-officers', book than any
that has appeared here from the other side. It deals exclusively
with the operations of the German right wing,
<span class="sc">Von Kluck's</span> own (first) army and his <i>liaison</i> with the
second (<span class="sc">Von B&uuml;low's</span>), during the move forward to the
Grand Morin, the allied counter-offensive and the establishment
of the line of the Aisne&mdash;that is from the twelfth of
August to the twelfth of September. The principal army
orders are given textually. An admirable map illustrates
each day's routes and billets for his first line and second
line troops, his cavalry and the extreme right of the second
army. <span class="sc">Von Kluck's</span> explanation of his breach of the
Supreme Command's orders and the man&oelig;uvre which
exposed him to <span class="sc">Manoury's</span> stroke was that, while ignoring
the letter, he was acting in the spirit of those orders on the
information available; that a pause to fulfil them literally
would have given the enemy time to recover; that defective
intelligence kept him ignorant of the fact that the German
left and centre had been definitely held by the French (if
he had known this he would not, he says, have crossed the
Marne). An examination of the frontispiece portrait suggests
that this fighting General would easily find excellent
reason for disobeying other people's orders and maintain
an obstinate defence of his own decisions once made, however
disastrous in result. Notes by the historical section
(military branch) of the Committee of Imperial Defence
point out inaccuracies and contradictions which the lay
reader would be unlikely to discover for himself. He will
however, if I mistake not, appreciate a soldierly narrative,
unspoiled by "political" parentheses or underestimation of
opponents, of what was undoubtedly a great military feat.
The German right wing covered the most ground and met
perhaps the toughest of the fighting.</p>

<p>I have found in <i>Lighting-up Time</i> (<span class="sc">Cobden-Sanderson</span>)
that all too rare thing, a theatrical novel of which the
vitality does not expire towards the end of the fourth
chapter. Obviously Mr. <span class="sc">Ivor Brown</span> knows the life of
modern stageland, one would say, with the intimacy of
personal experience. More important still, he commands
an easy style and a flow of genial, not too esoteric, humour
that combine to keep the reader chuckling and curious to
the last page. His title is characteristic, <i>Lighting-up Time</i>
symbolising here that period in the career of an actress
when her possibly waning attractions need the illumination
of a judicious boom. The two main characters are <i>Mary
Maroon</i>, the leading lady, and <i>Peter Penruddock</i>, the astute
publicity agent who engages to set her upon her financial
and artistic pedestal. <i>Peter</i>, in other words, is <i>Mary's</i> tide,
taken at the flood in chapter one, and leading her, very
divertingly, on to fortune. Both the tour of <i>Stolen or
Strayed</i> and the company that present it are admirably
true to life, while Mr. <span class="sc">Brown</span> has even been able convincingly
to suggest the atmosphere of theatrical Oxford,
when in due course
his mummers descend
upon that
home of lost comedies
and impossible
revues. If I
have a complaint
against the book it
is that a tale of
such pleasant irony
hardly needed the
general pairing-off
with which the author
rings down his
curtain; but for this
Noah's Ark I should
have more easily
believed in a story
that entertained me
throughout.</p>

<hr />

<p>There are some
forty-odd bits in
<i>A Bit at a Time</i>
(<span class="sc">Mills and Boon</span>),
and they embrace a variety of subjects, ranging from
crocuses in Kensington Gardens to corpse-boats on the
Tigris. They are all, whether sentimental, satirical or
pathetic, fiction of the lightest type. Such literature was
eminently readable during the War&mdash;most of Mr. <span class="sc">Dion
Clayton Calthrop's</span> bits have to do with somebody's "bit"&mdash;when
a touch of conventional pathos and pretended
cynicism and a generous padding of humour, real or forced,
provided sufficient relaxation from the strain of anxious
hours. But the wisdom of republishing them in book form
in these sober days of peace is open to question. When
Mr. <span class="sc">Calthrop</span> talks satirically of "perfect officials" or of
an earnest young American aviator who writes letters home
in a United States dialect that was never heard on land or
sea outside Bayswater, or of the war-time adventures of
one <i>Mr. Mason</i>, skipper, and <i>Mr. Smith</i>, his mate, he is
tolerably amusing. When he becomes serious, as in "The
Prayer of the Classical Parson" and "When the Son Came
Home," his limitations become increasingly apparent. Yet
it is in this vein that he gives us what is by all odds his
best bit, "The Chevalier of Carnaby Row." When he
writes of Cupids and fauns and Columbines and rose-leaves
and the sort of young females that find this environment
congenial (in books) I like Mr. <span class="sc">Calthrop</span> least. Perhaps
it is because the publishers have put his picture on the
paper cover. He looks much too stalwart and sophisticated
to be toying with such gossamer fantasies.</p>

<p>I doubt whether the complications which attend the devolution
of dead men's property were created for the confusion
of survivors or for the convenience of novelists. In the case
of <i>The Lost Mr. Linthwaite</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span>),
<i>Mrs. Byfield</i> had married <i>Mr. Byfield</i>, or at least she thought
she had, and <i>Mr. Byfield</i> had died, supposedly intestate.
Previously <i>Mrs. Byfield</i> had married <i>Mr. Melsome</i>, or again
she thought she had, and <i>Mr. Melsome</i> had disappeared and
was assumed to be dead, leaving nothing behind him except
a brother as vile as himself. The following discoveries
were made by her in due sequence: That <i>Mr. Melsome</i> was
not dead and that therefore she was not <i>Mrs. Byfield</i> but
<i>Mrs. Melsome</i>; that <i>Mr. Melsome</i> was already married when
he purported to marry her, and that therefore she was not
<i>Mrs. Melsome</i> but <i>Mrs. Byfield</i>; and that a solicitor's clerk
was absconding with the bulk of the <i>Byfield</i> estate, which,
of course, was what
the bother was all
about. Her son,
bitten with the
craze for discoveries,
then discovered
on his own that the
late <i>Mr. Byfield</i>
hadn't died intestate.
I wonder myself
if he ever really
died at all....
These are what Mr.
<span class="sc">J. S. Fletcher</span>
very aptly calls the
mere legalities; the
plot, which thickens
and thickens
from first page to
last, concerns the
handling of them
by the evil but talented
<i>Melsome</i>
brothers, the accidental
intervention
of <i>Mr. Linthwaite</i>, and the rescue work of his admirable
nephew, <i>Mr. Richard Brixey</i>, of <i>The Morning Sentinel</i>. Mr.
<span class="sc">Fletcher</span> tells his story well, but up to the very last
moment I was looking and hoping for a surprise and was suspecting
those legalities of being a deception invented to make
the surprise all the greater. A first-class adventure, in my
opinion spoilt by the sacrifice of originality to technicality.</p>
